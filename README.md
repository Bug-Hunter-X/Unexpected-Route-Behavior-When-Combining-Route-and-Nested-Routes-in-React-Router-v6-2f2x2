# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when combining `Route` and nested `Routes` in React Router v6.  The issue is that a button click within a nested route sometimes causes the application to behave erratically, not updating the UI correctly when clicking buttons or navigating back and forth between routes.
